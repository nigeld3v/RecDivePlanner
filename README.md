# RecDivePlanner
A tool for safer and easier dive planning for SCUBA divers. RecDivePlanner is an intelligent diving/depth calculator that corrects user inputs to protect the user (i.e. by rounding depths and time of dive up to the appropriate level) and provides them with information they would otherwise have to look up in using several cumbersome dive tables.
